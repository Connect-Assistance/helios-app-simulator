# Data directory

The concept of the data directory is simple: persist each of the driver's data in an easy to read format. You can have as many drivers as you want, each in its own file.

## Instructions

1. Copy and rename `__example__.json` to a sequential number like this: `001.json`, `002.json`, etc.
2. Replace the information in the JSON with the appropritate one:
   * Latitude and longitude can be extracted from [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/)
   * Right-click a location and click on the latitude/longitude coordinates

**NOTE: The drivers' credentials must exist in Helios for a successful login and subsequently appearing in the map.**
